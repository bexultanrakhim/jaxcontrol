# jaxcontrol
This is a repository to perform optimal control using jax and python.

Project is currently abandoned, because jax has several problems, especially with indexing the elements. Jax arrays are immutable, therefore, acessing indexes is quite slow, especially if it is done many times. Just in time compiler has a potential to be faster. I might continue working on this if it ever happens. But it was good to try it out and check it out.
